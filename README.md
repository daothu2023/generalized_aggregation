# generalized_aggregation
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for modeling graph structures, achieving high performance in various fields. Most GNNs are based on Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), updating node representations iteratively but only using information from k-hop neighbors.

This project proposes a new aggregation method that combines information from both neighboring nodes and distant nodes with high similarity, aiming to improve the performance of existing MPNN models. Evaluation results on multiple datasets demonstrate the potential of this method.

This repository contains the code to implement and evaluate the method on datasets like PTC, MUTAG, NCI1, DHFR, COX2, Proteins and DD
